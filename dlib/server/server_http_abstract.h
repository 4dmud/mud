            REQUIREMENTS ON server_base 
                is an implementation of server/server_iostream_abstract.h

            REQUIREMENTS ON map_ss_type
                is an implementation of map/map_kernel_abstract.h with 
                domain set to std::string and range set to std::string

            REQUIREMENTS ON queue_string_type
                is an implementation of queue/queue_kernel_abstract.h with 
                T set to std::string 

            WHAT THIS EXTENSION DOES FOR SERVER IOSTREAM
                This extension turns the server object into a simple HTTP server.
                It only handles HTTP GET and POST requests and each incoming request triggers the
                on_request() callback.  

            COOKIE STRINGS
                The strings returned in the new_cookies queue should be of the following form:
                    cookie_name=cookie contents; expires=Fri, 31-Dec-2010 23:59:59 GMT; path=/; domain=.example.net

                You don't have to supply all the extra cookie arguments.  So if you just want to
                set a cookie that will expire when the client's browser is closed you can 
                use a string such as "cookie_name=cookie contents"
